# Scenario

scenario.shelter.title=Shelter

scenario.shelter.story=While out camping, four of you were attacked by a single powerful creature. Together, you barely managed to take it down, but Ned didn't make it... All around, more red eyes told of awful things looming in the shadows.\n\nYou grabbed your supplies and made your way back to town, only to find it has been overrun, burning under a red sky. The Apocalypse has begun.\n\nThe three of you made your way to a nearby hidden valley that you used to hike to. It seems safe, for now. You should set up camp. Start with a shelter, a place to eat and rest.

scenario.shelter.mission=Build a log cabin with a food table and a bed.

scenario.research.title=Learning to farm

scenario.research.story=You now have a base of operations, but you are far from safe. Your supplies won't last forever. If you don't find a food and water source, you won't live long enough to worry about those creatures finding you.\n\nBefore you can grow your own food, you need to learn how.

scenario.research.mission=Build an experiment table and research "Farming".

scenario.farming.title=Food Source

scenario.farming.story=You figure out how to farm. Use this knowledge and build some farms. They will provide a steady supply of food.\n\nResources are running low, but there are plenty lying around in the area. You can chop trees for wood, quarry for stone and clay, or search debris for scraps.

scenario.farming.mission=Build 2 vegetable farms.

scenario.crafting.title=Arms

scenario.crafting.story=These farms should keep you fed for now, but when your colony grows you will need to build more farms. \nRemember you can't eat raw food, you will need to constantly prepare meals.\nKeep an eye on your water supply too. Gather water from a nearby well when it starts to run low.\n\nNow that you have basic supplies, you should prepare to defend yourselves. Make some weapons.

scenario.crafting.mission=Craft 2 clubs.

scenario.scavenging.title=Scavenging

scenario.scavenging.story=These weapons should help you defend your base from smaller groups of weaker demons. But in order to survive you can't just keep your head low. You need to figure out what is going on out there, and gather supplies from nearby towns.\n\nYou might want to make some better weapons before heading out. You already know how to make basic bows.

scenario.scavenging.mission=Scavenge a nearby location.

scenario.occultresearch.title=Investigating the Apocalypse

scenario.occultresearch.story=The world has turned to hell. It's only a matter of time before your small base is overwhelmed by hell's minions. You must figure out what went wrong and how to put a stop to this.\n\nWhile exploring, you saw several weird symbols and runes that you've never seen before. You should designate an area to study the occult and maybe figure out where all these demons are coming from.

scenario.occultresearch.mission=Build an occult library and research "Demon Origins".

scenario.growth.title=Safety in numbers

scenario.growth.story=Your best theory is that the barrier between hell and earth is diminished and hellspawn are able to make it through. It's not completely gone or the entire planet would be burning.\n\nYou learned of portals that the demons use to travel between the realms. They are well defended, you will need to be better prepared before you can investigate one.\n\nThis colony needs to grow stronger. Recruit some more survivors to join you, and make sure you have ample food supply.

scenario.growth.mission=Recruit 8 survivors and obtain 100 items of food.

scenario.portals.title=Portals

scenario.portals.story=The colony is growing as more survivors join. It's time to make a daring stand. Send a team to explore one of the demon's portals.\n\nBe careful, these portals are swarming with demons. Make sure you send a well armed, well trained team.

scenario.portals.mission=Investigate a portal

scenario.closedportal.title=Closing the portals

scenario.closedportal.story=Your team salvaged some weird essence from the portal. Research these portals and see what you can learn.\n\nThis is as far as the story goes in the current alpha build. The final release will have a longer, more detailed story, and will have more items, buildings, research and game mechanics. \n\nThank you for playing.

events.nighthowls.opening.text=In the end of times, civilization is a thing of the past. Gone is the electronic equipment that made life so much simpler, gone are the lights that kept the streets a bit safer at night and that kept us from seeing the beautiful night stars next to a glowing moon.\n\nSome might find this to be a romantic experience, were it not for the apocalypse. But it seems that {{survivor}} has developed a special interest in the night moon. This fascination was always apparent, but now it’s different. {{survivor}} can’t sleep anymore. {{survivor_hesheC}} walks around under the night sky, looking up at the moon. It’s perfect roundness, the subtle glow of off-white light shining in the distance spurs an uncontrollable urge. {{survivor_hesheC}} doesn't know where it came from, why or how; but it’s there - the urge to howl.\n\n{{survivor}} howls at the moon, and what may have started as a ridiculous imitation of a wolf cub, soon grows into a full fledged, blood chilling howl. The howl echoes in the distance, bouncing off abandoned buildings and ruined hideouts. {{survivor_hesheC}} eventually snaps out of it, but too late - the howl has attracted some unwanted attention!

events.nighthowls.research.title=Night Howls
events.nighthowls.research.text=This insatiable urge to howl will no doubt return, bringing further misfortune with it. You must find a way to deal with {{survivor}}.

events.nighthowls.foundwerewolf.title=Night Howls
events.nighthowls.foundwerewolf.text=Your occultists determined the source of this menace. It seems that {{survivor}} is inflicted with “the curse of the wolf”, an ancient curse told to drive men and women insane, making them believe they are wolves. This curse can be cured, however. All you need is… an actual wolf. More specifically, a werewolf. A small blood sample and a simple chant should remove this curse. The chant is easy to perform, but getting a blood sample will probably prove to be somewhat more difficult.\n\nYou remember hearing strange howls in the distance, surely it’s a werewolf. Perhaps you could convince the werewolf to donate some blood to a good cause… by brute force.

events.nighthowls.end.title=Night Howls
events.nighthowls.end.text={{survivor}} feels as if the weight of the world has been lifted off {{survivor_hisher}} shoulders. While the moon still shines bright and the stars still litter the night sky, the urge to howl is gone for good. Perhaps on all levels, {{survivor}} is no wolf, but a human being, eternally fascinated by the beauty of the night sky in a world desolated by the apocalypse.\n\nYou feel mystical power emenating from the claws of the werewolf, and form a pendant from it. Perhaps it will assist you in your struggles.

events.nighthowls.dead.title=Night Howls
events.nighthowls.dead.text=Death takes hold of {{survivor}}. {{survivor_hesheC}} will be sorely missed. {{survivor_hisherC}} body may be gone but {{survivor_hisher}} memory stays forever. With {{survivor_hisher}} death, the horrible curse is gone, and the camp no longer attracts unwanted attention.

events.badomens.research.title=Bad Omens
events.badomens.research.text=Dark clouds cover the night sky, the soft glow of the moon breaches through what little seams and holes it can find, illuminating with a weak, faint light, barely enough to see. A dark red comet streaks across the sky, coloring it in a dark, crimson red color. In what appears to be no less than witchcraft, the moon itself becomes red, its glow ominous. Demonic howls can be heard in the distance, these bad omens seem to give them unnatural strength.

events.badomens.resolved.title=Bad Omens
events.badomens.resolved.text=Your survivors discover an ancient manuscript mentioning a blood moon and an old religious ritual used to protect against it. After performing the ritual, the moon returns to its normal pale self, and the demonic howls immediately begin to wane. Things are back to normal.

events.badomens.expired.title=Bad Omens

events.blackbox.opening.text=The rubbles of what once was the pinnacle of human architecture lay strewn across the floor as a painful reminder of what was lost. Heavy bricks covered in dust and window fragments litter the roads and avenues of a once prospering city.\n\nA pile of rubble next to an abandoned building attracts your attention. Sure enough, the rubble holds a secret inside it - a black lockbox. The box is rather hefty, the lock in front of it seems to constitute quite a bit of its weight. It can probably be unlocked, using the proper tools.

events.blackbox.open4.title=The Black Box
events.blackbox.open4.text=You open the box, revealing several cloth-wrapped items with arcane symbols on them. Your occultists show great interest in these.

events.blackbox.open5.title=The Black Box
events.blackbox.open5.text=The box holds a rotten body part, covered by insects and maggots. You throw it away in disgust, only to watch them fly straight onto your fields!

events.blackbox.open6.title=The Black Box
events.blackbox.open6.text=You open the box and see a dollar sign greedily carved under the lid. The box is filled to the brink with bottle caps. Whoever prepared for the apocalypse had the wrong idea, why would you need bottle caps?

events.lowmorale.opening.title=Desperate Times
events.lowmorale.opening.text=As days go by, and no signs of rescue can be seen, exhaustion and despair are starting to take their toll.

events.lowmorale.reward2.text={{survivor}} ran all the way to the nearby ruins, ignoring any dangers on the way. A while later {{survivor_heshe}} made {{survivor_hisher}} way back to camp with a few scratches, and a splendid new bow.

events.lowmorale.reward3.title=Desperate Times
events.lowmorale.reward3.text={{survivor}} walks all around camp, hiding anything that might seem out of place, removing all tracks and trails. You'd have to walk right into camp in order to notice there was anything but wilderness around. The camp is well hidden now, it's unlikely the demons nearby are aware of it.

events.eureka.eureka.title=Eureka!
events.eureka.eureka.text=Some say that ideas are easy, and execution is all that matters. Scientific research, however, is driven by ideas. Ideas that can form by anyone, anywhere. Even in your sleep.\n\n{{survivor}} sometimes speaks in {{survivor_hisher}} sleep. Mostly nonesense, but today {{survivor_hisher}} ramblings led to a scientific breakthrough!

events.darkcurse.opening.title=Dark Curse
